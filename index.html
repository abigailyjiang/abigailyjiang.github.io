        <h3>hi! I'm Abigail.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a PhD student studying materials physics and solid-state chemistry at Harvard. 
            my work is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
            <br>as a scholar and reader, I'm also interested in questions about people and place via history, ethnic studies, and science & technology studies.
        </p>

        <p>
            previously, I studied materials science and history at Caltech, where
            I investigated energy materials with the <a href="https://www.seegroup.caltech.edu/">See Group</a> and quantum materials with the <a href="https://epitaxy.caltech.edu/">Falson Lab</a>,
            and wrote about <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16125/">urban development in Los Angeles Chinatown</a> with Profs. Maura Dykstra and Danielle Wiggins.
        </p>
        
        <p>outside of research and organizing, I'm usually powerlifting, wandering museums, reading a book
