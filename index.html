    <h3>hi! I'm Abigail. ðŸŒ±</h3>
    <p>
        <b>currently,</b> I'm a PhD Student at Harvard, studying condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry 
        with the <a href="http://mundy.physics.harvard.edu/">Mundy Group</a>.
        my work is generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
    
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a organizer and writer,</b> I'm also constantly thinking about people, place, and our sense of community - 
        ranging from the asian diaspora and american identity, to academia and its understanding of science as futurity.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>previously,</b> I studied materials science and history at Caltech, where
        I investigated energy materials with the <a href="https://www.seegroup.caltech.edu/">See Group</a> and quantum materials with the 
        <a href="https://epitaxy.caltech.edu/">Falson Lab</a>, wrote about <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16125/">urban development in Los Angeles Chinatown</a> 
        with professors Maura Dykstra and Danielle Wiggins, and advocated for peers within the university and
        <a href="https://medium.com/advancing-justice-aajc/a-new-generation-of-advocates-and-leaders-to-come-together-e431e12aad87">beyond</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>outside the lab,</b> I'm usually powerlifting, jamming to music, reading a book 
        (<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sabrina-imbler/how-far-the-light-reaches/9780316540513/?lens=little-brown">1</a> 
        <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374538668/blockchainchickenfarm">2</a> 
        <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538034/exhalation-by-ted-chiang/">3</a>),
        or dreaming about home in the Pacific Northwest.
