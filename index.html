    <h3>hi! I'm Abigail. ðŸŒ±</h3>
    <p>
        <b>currently,</b> I'm a PhD Student in Applied Physics at Harvard, coadvised across the
        <a href="http://mundy.physics.harvard.edu/">Mundy Group</a> and the 
        <a href="http://mason.chemistry.harvard.edu/">Mason Group</a>. my graduate education is generously supported by the 
        NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a physicist/chemist</b>, my research focuses on synthesis and characterization of novel materials that demonstrate 
        both fundamental quantum properties and functional energy applications. broadly, I'm interested in the intersections between 
        condensed matter physics and materials chemistry, and hope to continue these themes as I pursue an academic career.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a organizer/writer,</b> I'm also constantly thinking about people, place, and shared solidarities - particularly  
        in regards to asian america, academia, STEM education, and folks at the margins of these communities. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>previously,</b> I studied materials science and history at Caltech, where
        I investigated energy materials with the <a href="https://www.seegroup.caltech.edu/">See Group</a> and quantum materials with the 
        <a href="https://epitaxy.caltech.edu/">Falson Lab</a>, wrote about <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16125/">urban development 
        in Los Angeles Chinatown</a> with professors Maura Dykstra and Danielle Wiggins, and advocated for peers within the university and
        <a href="https://medium.com/advancing-justice-aajc/a-new-generation-of-advocates-and-leaders-to-come-together-e431e12aad87">beyond</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>outside the lab,</b> I'm usually powerlifting, cooking and crocheting, reading a book 
        (<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sabrina-imbler/how-far-the-light-reaches/9780316540513/?lens=little-brown">1</a> 
        <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374538668/blockchainchickenfarm">2</a> 
        <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538034/exhalation-by-ted-chiang/">3</a>),
        or dreaming about home in the Pacific Northwest.
