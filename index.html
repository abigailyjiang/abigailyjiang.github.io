    <h3>hi! I'm Abigail.ðŸŒ±</h3>
    <p>
        <b>currently,</b> I'm a PhD student studying materials physics and solid-state chemistry at Harvard. 
        my work is generously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship.
        [<a href="cv.html">cv</a>]
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a scholar and reader,</b> I'm also interested in questions about people and place through the lenses of history, ethnic studies, and science & technology studies.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>previously,</b> I studied materials science and history at Caltech, where
        I investigated energy materials with the <a href="https://www.seegroup.caltech.edu/">See Group</a> and quantum materials with the <a href="https://epitaxy.caltech.edu/">Falson Lab</a>,
        wrote about <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16125/">urban development in Los Angeles Chinatown</a> with professors Maura Dykstra and Danielle Wiggins,
        and advocated for underserved communities inside and 
        <a href="https://medium.com/advancing-justice-aajc/a-new-generation-of-advocates-and-leaders-to-come-together-e431e12aad87">outside</a> of the university.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>beyond research and organizing,</b> I'm usually powerlifting, jamming to music, reading a book 
        [<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sabrina-imbler/how-far-the-light-reaches/9780316540513/?lens=little-brown">1</a>

        <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/538034/exhalation-by-ted-chiang/">3</a>],
        or dreaming about home in the Pacific Northwest.
