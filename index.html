    <h3>hi! I'm Abigail. ðŸŒ±</h3>
    <p>
        <b>currently,</b> I'm a PhD Student in Applied Physics at Harvard, coadvised across the
        <a href="http://mundy.physics.harvard.edu/">Mundy Group</a> (Physics) and the 
        <a href="http://mason.chemistry.harvard.edu/">Mason Group</a> (Chemistry).
        my graduate education is generously supported by the NSF GRFP, the Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship, and the 
        <a href = "https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/abigail-jiang">Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a physicist/chemist</b>, I synthesize and characterize novel solid-state materials that demonstrate 
        fundamental quantum properties and functional energy applications, particularly superconducting and thermal phase-change thin films. 
        throughout my academic research career, I hope to continue exploring this intersection of condensed matter physics and materials chemistry.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>as a organizer/writer,</b> I'm also constantly thinking about people, place, and shared solidarities - particularly  
        in regards to asian america, academia, STEM education, and folks at the margins of these communities. 
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        <b>previously,</b> I studied materials science and history at Caltech, where
        I investigated electrochemical energy materials with the <a href="https://www.seegroup.caltech.edu/">See Group</a> and quantum materials with the 
        <a href="https://epitaxy.caltech.edu/">Falson Lab</a>, wrote about <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/16125/">urban development 
        in Los Angeles Chinatown</a> with professors Maura Dykstra and Danielle Wiggins, and advocated for peers within the university and

    </p> -->
    
    <p>
        <b>outside the lab,</b> I'm usually powerlifting, crocheting, reading a book 
        (<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sabrina-imbler/how-far-the-light-reaches/9780316540513/?lens=little-brown">1</a>

        or dreaming about home in the Pacific Northwest.
